I often work with `RectangleShape2D` shapes inside `Area2D` nodes.
This add-on makes easier the edition of those shapes.

## Features
- Edit multiple rect shapes from single Area2D at once.
- Drag'n'drop corner handles with left mouse button.
- Snap to viewport pixel.
- Show inner shapes only when selecting Area2D.

## Also
- Undo/redo capabilities.
- Cancel with ESC while dragging.

## Future
- Edit other shapes, like `ConcavePolygonShape2D` and `ConvexPolygonShape2D`.
- Configurable.
- Use native snap settings.
